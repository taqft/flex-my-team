<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Description

* A cool app to show off your team's collaboration and contact info!

* Built with NodeJS, this simple app allows you to generate an HTML file based on your team's details and contact info. I worked on this to save time when spinning up new project contact pages, and to serve as a base for future improvements and features to make our lives easier.

* This README file was generated with [auto-readme](https://github.com/theresaqueryforthat/auto-readme/)! Go check it out if you're interested in learning more!
